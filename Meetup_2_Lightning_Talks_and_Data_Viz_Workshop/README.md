A lot of you have been asking to see what other people are working on. This month we are shaking it up with some lightning talks with the theme "How have you used Data at work". More details to follow, if you want to give a talk get in touch with us here, Twitter or Slack.

## Talks:
* Alex Waters - "Publishing data in an open source world" - https://twitter.com/seeing_clearly
* Stacey Rey - "Data & Gamification" from https://twitter.com/arctic_shores and https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacey-ray-0a83ab8b/
* Tania - "PyLadies' plans for the Pythonistas in the NorthWest of England" - https://twitter.com/ixek
* Jennifer A Stark - "Python: from means and sums to text classification with deep learning" - https://twitter.com/_JAStark

Following these talks we will have a Data Visualization workshop. Data Visualization is about making an effort to help people understand the significance of data by placing it in a visual context. Come learn the basics of using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot altair and mapping for plotting with a workshop delivered by PyDataMCR's own John Carney [github repo](https://github.com/jaspajjr/pydata-visualisation). Don't forget to read the "What To Do before the meetup" to get setup to code along.

## What To Do before the meetup
The simplest way to install Python, and the most popular packages that make up the SciPy stack is with Anaconda, a cross-platform Python distribution for data analytics and scientific computing. Install here https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

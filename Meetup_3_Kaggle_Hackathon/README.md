“Kaggle is a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions in which people compete to produce the best models for predicting and describing the datasets uploaded by companies and users.” - mostly wikipedia

Competing in Kaggle competitions _can_ win you money, but most people do it for the challenge and to improve their skills. What is especially great is that people share their code and tips, ask questions, and give advice. Most people seem to work in R or Python.

This meetup we will each work through a practice competition, from creating our accounts to submitting predictions and seeing where we pop up on the competition leaderboards: Experience the whole process from beginning to end!

## Plan:
* ~15 min overview of the Kaggle Platform, make an account, understand public and private leaderboards, what is submitted and how we do that.
* You pick one of three “Getting Started” competitions: the classic Titanic dataset which is suitable for novices to both data science and Kaggling, and 2 others which are suitable for those with data science experience but are new to Kaggling. All these come with tutorials in both R and in Python.
* ~90 min of working through the tutorials or on your own or with your friends - it’s up to you
* ~15 min submitting your model
* feedback - how well did you do? Tips, questions, revelations …

## What should I do before the meetup?

To save time before the meetup, make sure you have some sort of environment set up, we recommend and will be able to assist with the SciPy stack. Installing pandas can be a little difficult for inexperienced users. The simplest way to install not only pandas, but Python and the most popular packages that make up the SciPy stack is with Anaconda, a cross-platform Python distribution for data analytics and scientific computing. Install here https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ .
All other tools are welcome too!

BYOL(Bring your own laptops!)
